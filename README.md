## Illinois Population Trend â€“ Analysis 


Illinois lost over 850,000 residents to other states during the past decade, with the largest population decline of all states for six consecutive years.

With over 200,000 news articles about Illinois and Chicago from Jan 2018 till Nov 2021, analysis was performed to identify the sentiment over years and the major reasons people and organization wanted to leave or stay in the Chicago City and Illinois State.

As per excerpts from one of the news article , decline in immigration, increasing crime, decreasing economic opportunities, heavy taxes and pandemic are the biggest reasons why the state continues to lose population and our analysis showed similar results with State tax, Crime, Pandemic and weather being major reasons for the negative sentiment about the city and people moving out.

Based on the research , recommend below actions to reverse the population trend.

	- Focus more on creating a job friendly environment across the state
	- Focus more on equity will lead to economy growth enhancing money making opportunities. 
	- Arguably a stronger employment climate leads to less crime and poverty. 
With the above 3, there will be more money flow to the state which can help in reducing tax burden to the residents and companies.

With the infrastructure and technological advancements, Chicago can become a hot spot . Chicago must persuade businesses big and small to set root in job-starved neighborhoods on the South and West sides, where the loss of African-American population endangers the health and future of those communities.
