I've had the Schlesinger (sp?) and the meatloaf club, both were amazing. The servers do tend to get confused during the rush, at one point we had two servers waiting on us who would have brought us two separate meals if we chose to let them continue. Have yet to be able to sit outside, its always crowded. \\nWill return for sure.\n","2  Positive  Positive                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         This place...will not quit!

Although I have been perfectly satisfied with the Avery Ranch location, the Westlake location is about 30 minutes closer to my home, which is why my last two visits have been at Westlake.\\n\\nBesides being a lovely, comfortable facility, customer service at Westlake has been nothing less than top-notch.  All of the ladies are extremely congenial and make you feel glad that you have chosen Face to Face for a relaxing, spa experience.\\n\\nI get a strong sense that my esthetician, Nicole, truly enjoys taking care of her clients. Nicole has approached each one of our sessions with enthusiasm, professionalism, and a genuine concern for my needs.  Without a doubt, I will continue using Face to Face spa for expert exfoliation services!"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":65}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"eV0dpyI6t9f0"},"source":["#### Load PreTrained Model "]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"gPyZem0WJq3H"},"source":["predictor = ktrain.load_predictor(modelPath+'yelp_Bert_model')"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"3taJaFe9qH_Z"},"source":["#print(load_predictor.predict(df_yelp.data.iloc[101]))"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Z4E2MvhXVXtl"},"source":["### Step 5 : Predict Sentiment on News Articles"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"a0E68d28Vg_b"},"source":["Read the news articles related to chicago and predict the sentiment for each of them"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":310},"id":"EjUKoL18U-T8","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1638424597691,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":13171,"user":{"displayName":"Surendiran R","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"18390139258981184421"}},"outputId":"a985e23e-aa63-43c0-d912-aedbee2522ee"},"source":["valdt_json = pd.read_json(dataPath+\"news_with_topic.json\",orient='records',lines=True)\n","valdt_json.head()"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>Unnamed: 0</th>\n","      <th>date</th>\n","      <th>language</th>\n","      <th>title</th>\n","      <th>text</th>\n","      <th>text_clean</th>\n","      <th>title_clean</th>\n","      <th>rake_phrases</th>\n","      <th>Top_Topic_Assigned</th>\n","      <th>Perc_Contribution</th>\n","      <th>Topic_Keywords</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>2021-07-23</td>\n","      <td>english</td>\n","      <td>chicago theater seating chart with seat numbers</td>\n","      <td>Chicago Theatre Seating Chart With Seat Number...</td>\n","      <td>Chicago Theatre Seating Chart With Seat Number...</td>\n","      <td>chicago theater seating chart with seat numbers</td>\n","      <td>mix wtmx chicago theatre seat numbers online c...</td>\n","      <td>60.0</td>\n","      <td>0.5188</td>\n","      <td>restaurant, food, order, pizza, menu, eat, ser...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>2021-07-24</td>\n","      <td>english</td>\n","      <td>harris theater chicago seating chart</td>\n","      <td>Harris Theater Seatmap Chicago Opera Theater C...</td>\n","      <td>Harris Theater Seatmap Chicago Opera Theater C...</td>\n","      <td>harris theater chicago seating chart</td>\n","      <td>harris theater seatmap chicago opera theater c...</td>\n","      <td>46.0</td>\n","      <td>0.2848</td>\n","      <td>chart, seating_chart, seat, guide, flight_deal...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>2020-12-15</td>\n","      <td>english</td>\n","      <td>There's a Big Tree Growing Through a Car in Il...</td>\n","      <td>Published: December 14, 2020 nanjan\\nWe're not...</td>\n","      <td>Published: December 14, 2020 nanjanWere not ex...</td>\n","      <td>Theres a Big Tree Growing Through a Car in Ill...</td>\n","      <td>illinois abandoned images troy shepard illinoi...</td>\n","      <td>87.0</td>\n","      <td>0.7097</td>\n","      <td>go, get, know, want, say, s, think, see, peopl...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>2020-03-05</td>\n","      <td>english</td>\n","      <td>Former Fox White House reporter Wendell Goler ...</td>\n","      <td>National News FILE - This May 4, 2010 file pho...</td>\n","      <td>National News FILE  This May 4, 2010 file phot...</td>\n","      <td>Former Fox White House reporter Wendell Goler ...</td>\n","      <td>2010 file photo shows fox news channels wendel...</td>\n","      <td>6.0</td>\n","      <td>0.4453</td>\n","      <td>say, vote, support, state, people, president, ...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","      <td>2020-12-30</td>\n","      <td>english</td>\n","      <td>I am looking forward to many things in 2021.
